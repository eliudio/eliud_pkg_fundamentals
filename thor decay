the issue


vanilla trades New York decay should be around 30% of the full day decay, but this is not the case on wednesday


What I need

1) Share graph please
2) Screenshot thor please

*** Wednesday to Thursday table -> problem

1) -19682.26 for the New York decay
2) -21,172.43 for the 24h decay

The 1) should be 25% of 2) because 1) is the move from 4PM to 10PM, which is 6 hours, which is 25% of 24h

However, we have the system date change in NY 5pm post dateroll, which is included in the 24h decay, 5699.76
We can consider 2) to be -21,172.43 - 5,699.76 = -26872.19
So reasnable New York decau should be -26872.19 / 4 = -6718.0475

*** Rolling from Thursday to Friday

there this "rule" is the case, 
1) -2711.65
2) -8990.47

Minus 3404.40 = -12394.87

25% of that number is -3098.7185

The NY 5PM decay is 2711.65, which is reasonably close to -3098.7185

Example trade 124299054
